Introduction

In today’s software industry, development goes far beyond writing code. Modern developers are expected to work efficiently with integrated development environments, version control systems, and collaborative platforms to build reliable and maintainable software. This assignment is designed to provide hands-on experience in creating a complete mini-project using Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub. Through this activity, you will learn how to structure a project, manage versions, document your work, and follow professional development practices. By completing these tasks, you will gain practical knowledge of real-world workflows that are essential for teamwork and modern software engineering.
